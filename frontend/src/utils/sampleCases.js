export const ameliaCase = `Case Narrative: Re: Amelia (age 5) and David (father)
Amelia was removed from David's care three months ago due to concerns of neglect.  The home was found to be unsanitary, with limited food available.  Amelia was frequently absent from school and often seen wandering the neighborhood unsupervised.  This is the second CFS intervention with the family; Amelia was briefly placed with her maternal grandmother two years prior due to similar concerns of neglect, though David regained custody within six months.
While David consistently expresses his love for Amelia and a desire to have her returned, his actions demonstrate a concerning level of ambivalence.  He has missed several scheduled visits, citing transportation issues, though he has not actively pursued solutions offered by the agency, such as bus passes. During visits, he appears distracted and struggles to engage with Amelia in age-appropriate activities. He repeatedly acknowledges his parenting struggles but has shown minimal engagement in the recommended parenting classes.  Furthermore, David's own childhood was marked by instability and neglect, mirroring the environment Amelia experienced in his care. While this doesn't preclude reunification, it underscores the learned patterns he must overcome.
Positively, David does have a supportive social network in the form of his older sister, who has been consistently involved in the case and has expressed willingness to assist with childcare and transportation.  Additionally, the current issues, while recurring, stem from David's ongoing struggles with depression and unemployment, rather than intentional maltreatment.  He has historically demonstrated an ability to meet Amelia's needs when his mental health is stable and he has consistent employment.
However, David's chronic unemployment and untreated depression represent significant barriers to reunification.  Although he was connected with mental health services following the initial CFS intervention two years ago, he discontinued treatment shortly after regaining custody of Amelia.  He has been reluctant to re-engage with services despite encouragement from both the case worker and his sister. This pattern of neglecting his own mental health needs contributes significantly to the cumulative risk factors impacting this case.  While the presence of a supportive family member and the situational nature of some of the presenting problems offer a glimmer of hope,  David's lack of consistent engagement in services, his ambivalence toward his parental responsibilities, and the recurrence of neglectful behaviors raise serious concerns regarding his capacity to provide a safe and stable environment for Amelia in the foreseeable future.  At this time, the prognosis for reunification remains guarded.  Continued assessment of David's engagement with services and his demonstrated ability to prioritize Amelia's needs will be critical in determining her permanency plan.`;
